# adobe-ptsd

### What

Create your adobe jsx scripts with rollup so you can use import/export es6 etc!

### Why

Because Adobeâ€™s IDE for making .jsx scripts makes me sad.

### Drawbacks

* loosing the autocompletion of the IDE. But I think it would be awesome if adobe released official typescript definitions for all their global objects. Do they?
* Not even close to official.
* Only works on a mac.

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install adobe-ptsd -g
```

### Usage

```bash
$ ptsd --script my-file.js --app photoshop
```
