# adobe-ptsd

### What

Create your adobe jsx scripts with rollup so you can use import/export es6 etc!

### Why

Because the ide for making jsx scripts makes me sad.

### Drawbacks

I think the biggest drawback is loosing the autocompletion of the IDE. But I think it would be awesome if adobe released official typescript definitions for all their global objects. Do they?
